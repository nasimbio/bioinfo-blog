# Welcome 👋

Hi, I’m **Nasim**, a bioinformatics scientist specializing in single-cell, spatial, and multi-omic data analysis.

I use this blog to document the topics I’m learning and working on.

Writing here helps me focus, organize my thoughts, and remember key concepts better.

Below you’ll find my posts and notes as I explore these areas.
