# Welcome 👋

Hi, I’m **Nasim Rahmatpour**, a bioinformatics scientist working on genomics, transcriptomics

single-cell, spatial, and multi-omic data analysis.

I use this blog to document the topics I’m learning and working on. I try to break down key concepts into 
simple, tutorial-stype explanation. My goal is to build a foundation of clear, accessible notes that help 
me and others to better understand fundamental bioinformatics topics.

Writing here helps me focus, organize my thoughts, and remember key concepts better.

Below you’ll find my posts and notes as I explore these areas.
